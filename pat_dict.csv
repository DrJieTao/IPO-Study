An abandoned application, in accordance with 37 CFR Â§Â§ 1.135 and 1.138, is one which is removed from the Office docket of pending applications.       -- see MPEP 711 for more            -- see express abandonment"
abandonment,"A trademark application that has been declared abandoned is ""dead"" and no longer pending. Abandonment occurs under several circumstances. The most common reason is when the USPTO does not receive a response to an Office Action letter from an applicant within 6 months from the date the Office action letter was mailed. Another instance is when the USPTO does not receive a Statement of Use (or request for an extension of time to file a statement of use) from an applicant within 6 months from the issuance of a Notice of Allowance). Applications abandoned for failure to respond to an Office Action or a Notice of Allowance can be revived or reinstated in certain circumstances.

likelihood of confusion,"a statutory basis (Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. Section 1052(d), TMEP Â§1207 et seq.) for refusing registration of a trademark or service mark because it is likely to conflict with a mark or marks already registered or pendingbefore the USPTO. After an application is filed, the assigned examining attorney will search the USPTO records to determine if such a conflict exists between the mark in the application and another mark that is registered or pending before the USPTO. The USPTO will not conduct any preliminary searches for conflicting marks before an applicant files an application and cannot provide legal advice on whether a particular mark can be registered.      The principal factors considered by the examining attorney in determining whether there is a likelihood of confusion are: (1) the similarity of the marks; and (2) the commercial relationship between the goods and/or services listed in the application.       To find a conflict, the marks do not have to be identical, and the goods and/or services do not have to be the same. It may be enough that the marks are similar and the goods and/or services related. If a conflict exists between your mark and a registered mark, the examining attorney will refuse registration on the ground of likelihood of confusion. If a conflict exists between your mark and a mark in a pending application that was filed before your application, the examining attorney will notify you of the potential conflict and possibly suspend action on your application. If the earlier-filed application registers, the Examining Attorney will refuse registration of your mark on the ground of likelihood of confusion."

mere descriptiveness,"statutory basis (Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. Section 1052(e)(1), TMEP 1209 et seq) for refusing registration of trademarks and service marks because the proposed mark merely describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose or use of the specified goods or services. With regard to trademark significance, matter may be categorized along a continuum, ranging from marks that are highly distinctive to matter that is a generic name for the goods or services.       The degree of descriptiveness can be determined only by considering it in relation to the specific goods or services. At one extreme are marks that are completely arbitrary or fanciful. Next on the continuum are suggestive marks, followed by merely descriptive matter. Finally, generic terms for the goods or services are at the opposite end of the continuum from arbitrary or fanciful marks.      The major reasons for not protecting descriptive marks are: (1) to prevent the owner of a mark from inhibiting competition in the sale of particular goods or services; and (2) to maintain freedom of the public to use the language involved, thus avoiding the possibility of harassing infringement suits by the registrant against others who use the mark when advertising or describing their own products.

The notice of allowance is important because the issue date of the Notice of Allowance establishes the due date for filing a statement of use. After receiving the Notice of Allowance, the applicant must file a statement of use or a request for an extension of time to file a statement of use within 6 months from the issue date of the notice.

Section 9 Renewal Application,"a sworn document, filed by the owner of a registration, to avoid the expiration of a registration. Federal trademark registrations issued on or after November 16, 1989, remain in force for 10 years, and may be renewed for 10-year periods. Trademark registrations issued or renewed prior to November 16, 1989 remain in force for 20 years, and may be renewed for 10-year periods. Trademark owners have a total of 18 months to file a Â§9 Renewal Application. The Â§9 Renewal Application may be filed one year prior to the registration expiration date or during the 6-month grace period immediately after the date of expiration. If the Â§9 Renewal Application is not filed or is filed after the grace period ends, the registration will expire.                 Because the due date of the 10-year Â§8 Declaration coincides with the due date of the Â§9 Renewal Application, the USPTO created a form entitled ""Combined Declaration of Use in Commerce and Application for Renewal of Registration of a Mark Under Sections 8 & 9""         -- see File a Â§8 & Â§9 Combined Declaration"
Section 15 Declaration of Incontestability,"a sworn statement, filed by the owner of a mark registered on the Principal Register, claiming â€œincontestableâ€ù rights in the mark for the goods/services specified. An â€œincontestableâ€ù registration is conclusive evidence of the validity of the registered mark, of the registration of the mark, of the ownerâ€™s ownership of the mark and of the ownerâ€™s exclusive right to use the mark with the goods/services. The claim of incontestability is subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in Â§Â§15 and 33(b) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§1065 and 1115(b). 15 U.S.C. Â§1065.                     Filing a Section 15 Declaration is optional. However, there are certain rules governing when one may be filed. A Â§15 Affidavit may not be filed until the mark has been in continuous use in commerce for at least five consecutive years subsequent to the date of registration for marks registered under the Act of 1946 (and subsequent to the date of publication under Â§12(c) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§1062(c), for marks registered under the Acts of 1905 and 1881 for which the benefits of the Act of 1946 have been claimed). The Â§15 Affidavit must be executed and filed within one year following a 5-year period of continuous use of the mark in commerce.                 Marks registered on the Supplemental Register are not eligible for claims of incontestable rights under Â§15.         -- see File a Â§15 Declaration"

One filing basis is use of the mark in commerce (the other three are filing based on an intent-to-use the mark in commerce, filing based on a pending foreign application, and filing based on a foreign registration). Applicants who file based on use in commerce must be using the mark they wish to register with the goods or services in the application prior to or at the time of filing the application.      To base the application on the applicantâ€™s use of the mark in commerce, the applicant must submit the following four items: (1) A statement that the mark is in use in commerce, as defined by 15 U.S.C. Â§1127, and was in use in such commerce on or in connection with the goods or services listed in the application on the application filing date; (2) The date of the applicantâ€™s first use of the mark anywhere on or in connection with the goods or services; (3) The date of the applicantâ€™s first use of the mark in commerce as a trademark or service mark; and (4) One specimen for each class showing how the applicant actually uses the mark in commerce. If the specimen is not filed with the initial application, applicant must submit a statement that the specimen was in use in commerce at least as early as the application filing date. These items must be verified by the applicant, i.e., supported either by an affidavit or by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. Â§Â§2.20 and 2.33. Trademark Act Section 1(a), 15 U.S.C. Â§1051(a); 37 C.F.R.

use in commerce,"For the purpose of obtaining federal registration, ""commerce"" means all commerce that the U.S. Congress may lawfully regulate; for example, interstate commerce or commerce between the U.S. and another country. ""Use in commerce"" must be a bona fide use of the mark in the ordinary course of trade, and not use simply made to reserve rights in the mark. Generally, acceptable use is as follows:       For goods: the mark must appear on the goods, the container for the goods, or displays associated with the goods, and the goods must be sold or transported in commerce.       For services: the mark must be used or displayed in the sale or advertising of the services, and the services must be rendered in commerce. If you have already started using the mark in commerce, you may file based on that use.       A ""use"" based application must include a sworn statement(usually in the form of a declaration) that the mark is in use in commerce, listing the date of first use of the mark anywhere and the date of first use of the mark in commerce. A properly worded declaration is included in the USPTO standard application form. The applicant or a person authorized to sign on behalf of the applicant must sign the statement. The application should include a specimen showing use of the mark in commerce."

Most of these could never be revived again, but Congress acted to restore those records that could be reconstructed from private files and reproduce models which were deemed critical. Patents whose records were not restored were cancelled. There were a total of 2,845 patents restored, most of which were eventually given a number beginning with ""X"". All patents after the date of the establishment of the Patent Office in July 1836 were numbered as a new series (without the X), beginning with a new Patent No. 1 to John Ruggles. A small number of the new series patents had been destroyed in the Great Fire but they were quickly recovered from their owners' records.     X files bear numbers that range from X000001 to X011280. X0000001 is the first patent, issued to Samuel Hopkins in 1790."
